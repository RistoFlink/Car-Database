# Car-Database
Small project built with Python, Django and Bootstrap.
Contains three seperate pages: list, add and delete.
You can see a list of all the cars in the database and add/delete them.

TODO:
Doesn't have any checks for the type of input from the user when adding new cars so should add that.
Adding more values for the cars in addition to brand and year.
